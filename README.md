# Rock, Paper and Scissor

**About The Project**

This is my first browser game inspired by an old game everyone knows: “Rock paper scissors”. Many of us used to play it in school to resolve disputes or just to spend the time. Here you can play it online. Choose one of the three choices - and see if you can beat the computer. Will you win? Your chances are random!
